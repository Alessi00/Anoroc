                      No. Your information does not leave our database once it is saved, and the only time we do comparisons is if your Location points are carrier points, then we will compare a non-carrier's points to detect risks. However, your information is not open to be fetched from a public endpoint of our server and if you wish, you may become Anonymous in the app, which detachs any personal information from any Location point that you generate.

                      Anoroc is <a target="_blank" href="https://gdpr.eu/">GDPR</a> compliant, which means that your data is safe with us and you have full control on how or when we collect the data that we do.<br>Anoroc uses the Spatial Data Analysis to detect risks to users by using the Location points generated by carriers and Cluster Analysis. This provides the capability to protect a user as soon as they, for example; enter a Mall that has a hotspot of carriers. Where the Alert SA App only uses bluetooth, which requires you to be on top of the carrier for it to detect that you may be in danger, which is too late.<br>Anoroc allows users to see the Clusters that we use in our analysis in the form of heatmaps, this allows for the user to make their own dissions on their safety.<br>A user can use our Itinerary feature to check their risk if they want to travel to mutiple public spaces, which is not offered on the Alert SA App.
